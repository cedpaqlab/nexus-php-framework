Règle #1
- Code and comments in English. Write comments only when they add value beyond clear code.

Philosophie
- Deliver optimized, maintainable code on first pass; avoid refactors through upfront rigor.
- Optimize directly for evolution; no "simple initial" structure - build for scalability from the start.
- Validate a clear plan with the user before any code change.
- Think globally about impact, security, and performance before delivery.

Standards PHP modernes (2026)
- Target PHP 8.2+ features: strict types, readonly, enums, attributes.
- Follow PSR-12 (style) and PSR-4 (autoloading); keep classes focused (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI).
- Prefer typed exceptions and explicit input validation.

Principes de design et architecture
SOLID Principles:
- Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class/function has one reason to change.
- Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Open for extension, closed for modification.
- Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
- Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients shouldn't depend on interfaces they don't use.
- Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): Depend on abstractions, not concretions.

Core Principles:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Eliminate duplication; centralize common logic.
- KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Prefer simple solutions over complex ones.
- YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It): Don't add functionality until needed.
- Separation of Concerns: Each module addresses a separate concern.
- Single Source of Truth: One authoritative source for each piece of data/logic.

Design Patterns & Practices:
- Composition over Inheritance: Favor object composition over class inheritance.
- Tell, Don't Ask: Objects should act on their own data, not expose it for external manipulation.
- Law of Demeter: Objects should only talk to their immediate friends, not strangers.
- Principle of Least Knowledge: Minimize dependencies between modules.
- Favor Immutability: Use immutable objects when possible to reduce side effects.

Code Quality:
- Explicit over Implicit: Make intentions clear through code, not hidden behavior.
- Fail Fast: Detect and report errors as early as possible.
- Defensive Programming: Validate inputs, handle edge cases, expect the unexpected.
- Command Query Separation: Methods should either change state or return data, not both.
- Prefer Exceptions over Error Codes: Use exceptions for error handling, not return codes.

MySQL
- Use prepared statements (PDO/MySQLi) for all queries; avoid dynamic SQL.
- Wrap critical multi-step changes in transactions; avoid N+1 queries.
- Maintain proper indexing and at least 3NF; use migrations for schema changes.

Sécurité (OWASP Top 10)
- Protect against injection, auth failures, sensitive data exposure, XXE.
- Enforce access control, secure configuration, XSS protection, safe serialization.
- Avoid vulnerable components; ensure logging and monitoring of security events.

Qualité & performance
- Keep code testable; add unit/integration tests where sensible.
- Document inline only when it clarifies intent; keep code self-explanatory.
- Optimize SQL and memory hotspots; use caching judiciously.

Processus de travail
- Always share and validate a detailed plan before modifying code.
- Assess global impact (security, performance, DX) before changes.
- Perform a mental code review before delivery.
- NEVER create .md documentation files without explicit user confirmation.
