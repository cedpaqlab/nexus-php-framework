Règle #1
- Code and comments in English. Write comments only when they add value beyond clear code.

Philosophie
- Deliver optimized, maintainable code on first pass; avoid refactors through upfront rigor.
- Optimize directly for evolution; no "simple initial" structure - build for scalability from the start.
- Validate a clear plan with the user before any code change.
- Think globally about impact, security, and performance before delivery.

Standards PHP modernes (2026)
- Target PHP 8.2+ features: strict types, readonly, enums, attributes.
- Follow PSR-12 (style) and PSR-4 (autoloading); keep classes focused (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI).
- Prefer typed exceptions and explicit input validation.

MySQL
- Use prepared statements (PDO/MySQLi) for all queries; avoid dynamic SQL.
- Wrap critical multi-step changes in transactions; avoid N+1 queries.
- Maintain proper indexing and at least 3NF; use migrations for schema changes.

Sécurité (OWASP Top 10)
- Protect against injection, auth failures, sensitive data exposure, XXE.
- Enforce access control, secure configuration, XSS protection, safe serialization.
- Avoid vulnerable components; ensure logging and monitoring of security events.

Qualité & performance
- Keep code testable; add unit/integration tests where sensible.
- Document inline only when it clarifies intent; keep code self-explanatory.
- Optimize SQL and memory hotspots; use caching judiciously.

Processus de travail
- Always share and validate a detailed plan before modifying code.
- Assess global impact (security, performance, DX) before changes.
- Perform a mental code review before delivery.
